"""backend URL Configuration

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))

This is the final step that completes the building of the API, 
we can now perform CRUD operations on the Todo model. 

The router class allows us to make the following queries:
/todos/ - This returns a list of all the Todo items
    (Create and Read operations can be done here).

/todos/id - this returns a single Todo item using the id primary key
    (Update and Delete operations can be done here).

Restart the server and visit this address â€” http://localhost:8000/api/todos
